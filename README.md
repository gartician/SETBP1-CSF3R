Key Points:

* We find that mutant SETBP1 enhances transcription of Myc and Myc target genes to promote aggressive disease biology.

* In cell line models and human SETBP1-mutant CNL cells, these oncogenic programs can be reversed by LSD1 inhibitors.

## Abstract

Colony stimulating factor 3 receptor (CSF3R) mutations lead to JAK pathway activation and are the molecular hallmark of chronic neutrophilic leukemia (CNL). Approximately half of CNL patients also have mutations in SET binding protein 1 (SETBP1). In this study, we developed models of SETBP1-mutant leukemia to understand the role that SETBP1 plays in CNL. SETBP1 mutations promote self-renewal of CSF3R-mutant hematopoietic progenitors in vitro and prevent cells from undergoing terminal differentiation. In vivo, SETBP1 mutations accelerate leukemia progression, leading to the rapid development of hepatosplenomegaly and granulocytosis. Through transcriptomic and epigenomic profiling, we found that SETBP1 enhances progenitor-associated programs-most strongly upregulating Myc and Myc target genes. This upregulation of Myc can be reversed by LSD1 inhibitors. In summary, we find that SETBP1 mutations promote aggressive hematopoietic cell expansion when expressed with mutant CSF3R through the upregulation of Myc-associated gene expression programs.
