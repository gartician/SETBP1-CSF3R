# Carratt-SETBP1-CSF3R

setbp1-csf3r mutation combination project for Sarah Carratt

CUT&TAG: DoxB (high) and DoxWdB (low SETBP1) conditions. H3K4me1,H3K4me3,H3K27Ac,IgG.

CUT&TAG-old: Same as CUT&TAG but using callpeaks (proto-gopeaks)

ChIP-Seq: Analyze public SETBP1 ChIP-Seq data and then intersect with our DE cut&tag intervals + MYC + MYB binding sites (also public data).

atac_seq: Assess epigenetic changes at 6 hr of drug treatment

cite_seq: CSF3R-T618I + SETBP1-mut patient sample treated with ORY-1001 for 24 hrs + CITE-Seq. We found decrease in MYC expression.

cite_seq_primary: alignment of reads to the hg38-2020-A with cellranger v5.0.1.

K562-RNA-Seq: SETBP1 mutation +- CSF3R(T618I) in K562 cells. Dox = with SETBP1, DoxWd = without SETBP1
